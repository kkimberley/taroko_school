# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# Create a default path
  Path.create(title: 'HTML/CSS', description: 'Learn the fundamentals of design, front-end development, and crafting user experiences that are easy on the eyes.')
